  <h2>Mission</h2>
  Music is a unifying factor throughout many people's lives. This underlying thread is something that can connect us all.

  ComMUSICty is a Girl Scout Gold Award created by Jocelyn Chin. Each week, high school volunteers work with various participants to teach them music. Currently, ComMUSICty is partnered with Lifestyles for the Disabled to teach developmentally disabled adults.
